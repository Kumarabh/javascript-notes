- bind() makes a permanent context link and will always keep it. A bound function cannot change its linked context when using .call() or .apply() with a different context or even a rebound doesn't have any effect
  // Only the constructor invocation of a bound function can change an already bound context, but this is not something you would normally do (constructor invocation must use regular, non-bound functions)
